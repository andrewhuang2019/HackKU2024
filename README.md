## Introduction  

This is _____, your innovative solution to diagonosing which restaurant you were food poisoned by!  

## Quick Start 

1. Download the latest release posted on GitHub.  
2. Download dependencies of the program located [here](#dependencies)  
3. Use the command below in the front_end directory to run the project:   
```python flaskFile.py```

## About the Project
_____ was created in 36 hours for the HackKU hackathon in Lawrence, Kansas. It aims to solve the problem that people face when choosing a place to order food, while also keeping track of which food places may have caused food poisoning to occur.  

## Challenges 
During the event, we faced many challenges in implementing the project as we intended. The main difficulty was figuring out how to get the data submitted by the user from the html files to the databases which were handled by python.  

## Resources Used
We combined HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Flask to build the front-end/UI side of the project.  
To create the extensive back-end, we used Python and SQL to populate the data and make use of the APIs in our project.  

## What we learned
Each of us decided to tackle a challenge by being a part of development that was most unfamiliar to us. For example, Andrew and Cooper worked together on the front-end application, creating low and high fidelity prototypes of the design and using languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript) that they were not familiar in. On the other hand, John and Keaton chose to work with SQL databases and APIs with queries in order to supply our product with core functionality - concepts which they had little experience in before.  

### Dependencies
```pip install python-google-places```
